#tree

- Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at 
most 2 children.
- Just recursively call the a function that swaps children at every level
- Take the NIL node as you base case.
- Time complexity is $O(n)$
- Space complexity is $O(n)$ because of the call stack in recursion.
