#binary-search
- This question just ask us to implement a binary search algorithm
- Base on the value of the middle of an array with respect to the target, either consider
	- The **left** side as **new array** to search if target is less than middle
	- The **right** side as **new array** to search if target is greater than middle
	- The **middle** value is the same as the target
	- **No solution** if the new array has just on element which is not the target
