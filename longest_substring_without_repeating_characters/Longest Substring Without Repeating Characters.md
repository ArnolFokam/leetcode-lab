#sliding-window 
- This problem is fairly intuitive to solve
- Once you have a mental model solution of the solution, it becomes easier to solve it.
- Here is how we would go to solve the problem
- We have a first pointer that determines the start of the substring
- We have a second pointer that determins the current end of the substring
- Now, how do we update these pointers
- We keep a dictionary of seen characters such that
	- While moving the second pointer to the end of the string
	- If it points to a character we have already seen in the past and is in our current substring (we could have seen it in the past and already update our substring)
	- We update the left pointer such that it contains the next character that has only been seen once. That is **left_pointer  + 1**
- **Caution:** We need to make sure that we update the **seen** data structure accordingly.
- Update the index of the seen characters such that we do not hit the previous condition for characters that were already encountered and skipped.
