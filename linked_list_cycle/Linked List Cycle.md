- Have a memory of seen node.
- When encountering a node, append a unique property about it in a set (id(none))
- Every time you encouter a new node, you should check if it not already present in the seen set.
- This can be done in O(1) time complexity
- **Time:** O(n) 
- **Space:** O(n)

- Another solution which is constant time.
- When encountering a node, modify its value to something outside the desired range
- Then, there is a duplicate if and only if we see this updated value somewhere
- This is because since this value is outside the range of possible values our nodes can take, then it must have been through prior manipulation.
- As a result, we are sure it was seen  early.
 - **Time:** O(1) 
- **Space:** O(n)
