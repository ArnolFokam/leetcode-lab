- We need a data structure that has order (linked list, array)
- We need a data structure we can add element from both ends in O(1) (linked list doubled)
	- To insert the newest used
	- To keep track of the least use
- We need a data structure whose element can be accessed and modified in O(1)
	- To update the newest use value if it was already used
		- Remove it where it is
		- Append it to the right
- We can use a dicionary that contains addresses to nodes in a linked list.
