- This problem requires us to have a data structure that makes it possible to retrieve the least  used key in O(1)
- We need to a mechanism to keep track of usage
- Using a data type that keep track of one value would be sus as if this the key in the data type gets remove, we do not know what to remove next
- We could use a list and arrange this list such that the least elements are always in order.
- How?
	- Always keep them in increase usage order
	- If usage get +1 bigger and is greater that next elemet, swap values
