#1D-DP  
- base case: last and before last stairs each have min cost as their current value
- sub-problem: ways[i] = 
	- **+** ways[i + 1] (case where we do not combine with left)
	- **+**  ways[i + 2] (case where we combine with left)  if:
		- i + 1 is less than length of string (i + 2 has a line in the dp column)
		- s[i] and s[i + 2] have combinations that can be mixed eg. 11, 16, 26
- iteration: i will for from the last to the first element
- base cases: ways[after the end of the string] = 1, ways[i] = 0 if s[i] = "0"
- Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate characters
- Space complexity is O(n) if we keep the history. O(1) if we just keep track of the previous values.
